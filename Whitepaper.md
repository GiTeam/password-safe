## Stack of technologies:
- Tokio-rs (rust event-loop based framework)
- Angular for ui (newest, fast js-framework)
- LetsEncrypt certbot-auto (for free HTTPSecure)
- Some Encrypt technologies (?)

- Some auth tools for 2-factor authorities

## MVP:
- product as box with dockerfiles for fast deploy
- SSL
- 2-factor auth
- REST API (+ swagger notation)

- password generator (like random.org maybe use API of random.org)
